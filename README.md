# Data Science ETL Process with Gapminder Data

## Introduction
This project focuses on the ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) process using datasets from Gapminder.org, specifically related to life expectancy and population statistics. The aim is to load, manipulate, and visualize data to gain insights into global health and economic trends. Effective data management and warehousing are crucial for making informed decisions based on data analysis.

By working with actual datasets, participants can appreciate the challenges and intricacies of data management.

## Skills
- Data Integration: Combining data from multiple sources for comprehensive analysis.
- Data Cleaning: Ensuring data quality by handling missing values and inconsistencies.
- Database Management: Understanding how to manage and query datasets effectively.
- SQL Proficiency: Gaining experience in using SQL for data manipulation.
- Data Analysis: Developing skills to analyze and interpret data trends.

## Exercises
### Exercise 01: Load My Dataset
- **Description**: This exercise involves creating a function to load a CSV dataset, specifically focusing on life expectancy data. The function outputs the dimensions of the dataset and handles potential errors gracefully.
- **Relevance**: Understanding how to load and validate datasets is fundamental in data science, as it sets the stage for further analysis and visualization.

### Exercise 02: Draw My Country
- **Description**: In this exercise, the program utilizes the load function to visualize life expectancy data for a specific country. The graph includes titles and legends for clarity.
- **Relevance**: Visualizing data helps in understanding trends and patterns, making it easier to communicate findings effectively.

### Exercise 03: Compare My Country
- **Description**: This exercise expands on the previous one by comparing life expectancy data of a chosen country against another. The visualization includes data from 1800 to 2050, with appropriate titles and legends.
- **Relevance**: Comparative analysis is crucial in data science, allowing for insights into how different factors affect life expectancy across countries.

### Exercise 04: Draw My Year
- **Description**: This exercise involves creating a projection of life expectancy in relation to GDP for the year 1900. It combines data from multiple sources and visualizes the relationship between economic status and health outcomes.
- **Relevance**: Understanding correlations between economic indicators and health metrics is vital for policy-making and resource allocation.

## Conclusion
This project provides valuable practical experience in data manipulation, visualization, and analysis. Participants gain insights into the ETL process and develop essential skills for a career in data science.
